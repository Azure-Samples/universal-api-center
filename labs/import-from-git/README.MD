Playground to experiment importing APIs in the OpenAPI specification into API Center by crawling Git repositories.

üí° Every step outlined below leverages the power of PowerShell scripts. This is designed so you can seamlessly integrate them into your automation workflows, CI/CD pipelines, webhooks, and more.

### Learning Objectives - Upon completing this lab, you should be able to:
- Deploy Azure API Center using Bicep.
- Configure the API Center metadata scheme for APIs, Environments and Deployments.
- Understand the Azure CLI commands to manage Azure API Center. [Full list of commands available here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/apic?view=azure-cli-latest).
- Create an enviroment with custom metadata properties 
- Register an API using the OpenAPI spec as the source of truth and assign API metadata properties.
- Register an API with individual commands to have full control over all the properties. 
- Search and discover the APIs registered in API Center.

### üöÄ Get started
Proceed by opening the [Jupyter notebook](import-from-generic-openapi.ipynb), and follow the steps provided.

### üóëÔ∏è Clean up resources
When you're finished with the lab, you should remove all your deployed resources from Azure to avoid extra charges and keep your Azure subscription uncluttered.
Use the [clean-up-resources notebook](clean-up-resources.ipynb) for that.
